- 👋 Hi, I’m Liam Doughty

- 👀 I’m interested in front end web development and creating efficient data structures in C.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript through self taught examples and applications. I am also enrolled in the engineering program at the University of Guelph
in Ontario CAN.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I am extremely interested in developing my programming skills and learning new things in any way I can. I am currently looking for summer employment in Canada for the months of May-August 2022 and am eager to gain important insight into the process of developing industry level code.

- 📫 I can be reached by email at 'liamdoughty5@gmail.com'.
