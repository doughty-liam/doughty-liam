Hi, i'm Liam

I am currently pursuing an Undergraduate degree at the University of Guelph in the Engineering Systems and Computing program. I am interested in C and Python development but have never turned down an opportunity to learn a new programming language or tackle a challening new concept!

I am looking for a summer internship to enhance my skills and knowledge of data science/analytics, machine learning, and the SDLC through hands-on work within a multi-disciplinary team. 

For examples of my most recent work on neural network's, please see my _discord_ repository or contact me directly here: liamdoughty5@gmail.com.
